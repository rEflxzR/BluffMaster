# QUMONG US APP
This idea for this App format was taken from Among Us.

## Steps
1. Clone the Repo
2. cd into the Main folder via terminal
3. Enter this command - "cd frontend/ && sudo npm install && cd ../api/ && sudo npm install && cd ../frontend/"
4. Now start the App using - "sudo npm start"
5. Browse to "http://localhost:3000"
6 Players are required to participate in the Game. (And a Quiz Host ofc :P)

Default login for Admin is -> Username - 'qlimaxz', Password - 'skip2020'. (Dont try it on my other accounts, You will be wasting your time XD)

Enjoy :)
